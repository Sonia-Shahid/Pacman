Pacman Game (Java)
A console-based Pacman-inspired game built in Java. The maze is represented with walls (#) and eatables (.). Pacman follows a directed movement pattern while ghosts move randomly. The game continues until Pacman eats all the dots or gets caught by a ghost.

Features
Maze grid with eatables (.) and boundaries (#)
Pacman with directed movement
Two random-moving ghosts
Collision detection between Pacman and ghosts
Scoring system based on collected dots
Game-over conditions (caught by a ghost or all dots eaten)

How It Works
Pacman starts at a defined position and moves through the maze.
Ghosts move randomly at each step, avoiding walls.
Each move updates the maze state on the console.
The game ends when Pacman eats all the dots (win) or a ghost collides with Pacman (loss).

Technologies Used
Java (Object-Oriented Programming concepts: classes, objects, composition, constructors, getters & setters)
Console-based grid rendering

Future Improvements
Add multiple levels with increasing difficulty
Introduce more ghosts and smarter ghost AI
Add lives and bonus scoring system
Implement a GUI version
